Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I added the HTML document elements, meta tags, and linked CSS files.
Then added divs and classes. Along with page-to-page navigation and a dropdown menu. Inputed structural and semantic HTML. Used a form, with input elements and submit button. Added images, used media and added different fonts and colors.
