    <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
    <h2>Robert Frost</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>Some say the world will end in fire,</p>
    <p>Some say in ice.</p>
    <p>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire</p>
    <p>I hold with those who favor fire.</p>
    <p>But if it had to perish twice,</p>
    <p>I think I know enough of hate</p>
    <p>To say that for destruction ice</p>
    <p>Is also great</p>
    <p>And would suffice.</p>
