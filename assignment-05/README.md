A page can have 4 main document elements. The first element is the document type which tells the browser's processor what type of HTML document it is. The second element is the root element which contains all other elements and text. The third element is the head element which contains the processing information and document metadata. The fourth element is the body element which is a contained for all the content and date that is intended to be displayed on a browser's page.
Structural markup is the elements used to describe both headings and paragraphs. Semantic markup provides extra information, such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation, or the meaning of an acronym, and so on.
The work I did this cycle included using meta elements, semantic markup, using ordered and unordered lists, including links to emails and external sites, and also inserting an address and HTML comment.
