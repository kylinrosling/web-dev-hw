I have come across forms while online shopping, and they are used for your name, address, billing information, and payment information.

Text: an example would be when you put in your phone number for sms updates on a package.
Selection: selection input is used for online surveys and tests.
Input: this can be used when submitting a test online or clicking enter when logging into a website.

During my work cycle I created the assignment-06 folder with all the corresponding files. I added all of the document and meta elements. I choose Baskin Robbins as my business. I added there address and phone number and email (they didn't have an email so I made one up) to contact them along with the hours they are open.
