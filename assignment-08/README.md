Im excited to keep building on what we have already learned and also expand my knowledge and get more comfortable with HTML's and Github.

In this work cycle, I created three HTML pages and added the four main document elements along with the four meta elements. I added style elements to tie the three pages together. In the contact.html I added input element and a submit button. I included a table element and a couple images elements.
