      <h1>How to open a door:</h1>
      <p> Doors can close the passageway from one room to another or from one
        room to outside. They can help with privacy and isolation from outside
        things like bugs and allergens. In this tutorial, I will teach you how
        to open a door.</p>

      <p id= "step-01" class="centered">
      <p> First you need to locate a door that you would like to open and make
        sure that it is currently closed. Trying to open an already open door
        can look a bit strange.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="step 02-block"class="page-block" class="centered"><h3>Step 2:</h3>
      <img scr="./images/step-02.jpg" />
      <p id= "step-02" class="centered">
      <p>Locate the handle or knob on said door. This is what is used to open
         a door.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="step 03-block"class="page-block" class="centered"><h3>Step 3:</h3>
      <img scr="./images/step-03.jpg" />
      <p id= "step-03" class="centered">
      <p>Grab hold of said handle or knob and turn it around 90 degrees either
        clockwise or counter-clockwise and either pull or push. If you pull and
        nothing happens, then that means that the door opens away from you. So
        go ahead and push while still holding the knob or handle turned around
        90 degrees. After you have opened the door a sufficient amount to
        walk through, you can let go of the handle and walk through the
        doorway.</p>
