Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.
The colors I chose were lavender: CE96FB, teal: O37A90, and aqua: 00C2BA. I felt that these colors represent what you think the 80's would be like, kind fun and uplifting.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I added the four main elements and 4 meta elements, in the head element I created a style.css and added a link element. I also added divs with classes to add structure to the page.
