System fonts: are installed on your device. They are available in most programs we use.
Web fonts: are custom fonts hosted on a server. They don't have to be available on the user's device to appear.
Web-Safe fonts: are fonts that developers can count on being available by the system. These include fonts that Windows and Mac should both have.

Fallback & font stacks try to load your first font. And if the computer does not have a font matching that name, it will try the second font, then the third font, then finally the default font of the font family you chose.

I created my assignment 10 folder and included a CSS folder and a folder for fonts and also an index file and README file. In the index file, I included the 4 main document elements and the 4 meta elements. I added a link from the css style sheet to the index file. I included divs, classes, and ids in my page. I added a link to a website with the authors information, I also included the title and publishing date of my passage. I used structural and semantic elements in my passage. I used two complimentary fonts and included a fallback font for each. I set the font size, weight and style for my title. I adjusted the spacing and alignment of an element and also added a pseudo-element and styled a link with a hover pseduo-class.
