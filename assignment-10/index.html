      <p>Life is not supposed to overwhelm you at all times. Life isn’t meant to be merely survived—it’s meant to be <i>lived</i>. <br />
        Seasons or instances will inevitably feel out of your control, but the moments when you feel like you’re drowning are supposed to be brief. They should not be the whole of your existence! The precious life you’ve been given is like a ship navigating its way across the ocean, and you’re meant to be the captain of the vessel. Certainly there are times when storms toss you around or cover the deck with water or break the mast clean in half—but that’s when you need to fight your way back, to throw all the water off the boat bucket by bucket. That’s when you battle to get yourself back to the helm. This is your life. You are meant to be the hero of your own story.</p>

      <p>This doesn’t mean you become selfish. This doesn’t mean you discard your faith or quit believing in something greater than yourself.<br />
        What it means is taking responsibility for your own life and your own happiness. Said another way—a harsher, more likely-to-get-me-punched-in-the-face way—-if you’re unhappy, <i>that’s on you</i>.</p>

      <p>When I say unhappy, I mean <i>unhappy</i>. I don’t mean <i>depressed</i>.<br />
        True depression has everything to do with your genetic makeup and the chemical balance in your body. I also don’t mean <i>sadness</i>. Sadness or grief brought on by circumstances outside of your control—like the soul-shredding loss of a loved one—is not something that can be walked through quickly or easily. Sadness and pain are things you have to sit with and get to know or you’ll never be able to move on.</p>

      <p>When I say unhappy, I mean discontented, unsettled, frustrated, angry—<br />
        -any of a number of emotions that make us want to hide from our lives instead of embracing them with arms wide open like a Creed song. Because happy people—the ones who are enjoying their lives 90 percent of the time—-do exist.</p>
