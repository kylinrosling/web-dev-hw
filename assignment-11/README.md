3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment
I added the 4 main document elements and 4 meta elements.
In the head element I added a link element and created a style.css and link using a relative URL. I created my sketched layout, structuring it with divs, utilizing classes and/or ids. In my style.css I set the size of an element along with the border of the element, the padding of the element, the margin of the element, the display of the  element, the position of the element, and the float of the element. Then I added one element with a hover pseduo-class to the layout.
