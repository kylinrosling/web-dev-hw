My clients were families that needed a website on simple photography that was capable of showing the services that i provided and also providing clients with a form to schedule appointments.

Display: block is often used to create vertical menus out of lists. The display: inline rule forces elements to act like inline elements. The display: inline-block rule removes new lines inherent in block elements.

I created 4 HTML pages and added the 4 main document elements and 4 meta elements.
In every HTML page I added link elements for your stylesheets and also a nav bar with links to all the html pages. I create a dropdown menu with links to other websites. I created a form element, included image elements, and used divs, classes, and ids. In my css, I used positioning elements, color properties and fonts.
